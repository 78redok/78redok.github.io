        <h2>Créma: Design Story</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="proj-item">
            <p>Many students, working professionals and everyone in between love to get a 
            cup of brew to get their mornings off to a right start. Among those individuals, 
            there are many who additionally enjoy the ambiance of a café to be productive. 
            While the desire to fulfill this yearning may be strong, at times it is met with 
            an abrupt cessation as they realize that there are no more seats available at 
            their favorite cafés; much often too late. This can be a troublesome occurrence 
            at day break because the rest of their day can be altered adversely.
            </p>
            <figure class="proj-img">

            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Artifact 1 - Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>“Have you ever walked to a cafe to study, only to find that there are no tables open? 
            Now you have to find another cafe and take your chances there. The time of busy students 
            is precious. Our company, beanleaf, is developing Créma, an innovative 
            approach to boost personal productivity and cafe operational efficiency. <b>Créma 
            is designed to help college students who love coffee and like studying at cafes solve 
            issues with maximum capacity limits being met and the inability of finding a seat.</b> It will 
            provide live space availability information through AWS Panorama API calls and our own 
            patented AI machine learning algorithm to notify users of the probability of securing a seat.”</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align: right">Meet Our Team!</h3>
        <div class="proj-item-left">
            <p>Our team is composed of like-minded individuals who all wish to see an alleviation to this problem. 
                With backgrounds in computer science, software engineering and informatics, this was a team that was 
                well equipped to handle this task.<b> My name is Richard.</b>
            </p>
            <figure class="proj-img">
                <img class ="myImg" src="./img/team.png" alt="Team Picture">
                <figcaption>Meet the Team!</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p><b>For the following artifacts, I will explain my role in how I contributed to this design project by 
            illustrating the process of design and my personal journey through it all.
        </b><p>
        <br>
        <h3>Artifact 2 - Surveys and User Interviews</h3>
        <div class="proj-item">
            <p>As our team was getting situated, we decided that the best approach forward would
               be to pay particular attention to the user base we want to support. With that, Chessah suggested
               that we put together a survey to get quantitative data, while each individual conducts
               a 1 on 1 user experience interview to get qualitative data. <b>I had the privilege of interviewing
               a fellow student who shall be known as "Stacy"</b>, and through her responses I was able to
               garner a better idea of what students prefer in the café experience.
            </p>

                <figcaption>User Interviews</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3 style="text-align: right">Artifact 3 - Design Workshop / Affinity Diagramming</h3>
        <div class="proj-item-left">
            <p>Using the data collected from our surveys and user interviews, our team decided to hold a
               design workshop where we can bring together our interview and survey data to try and make
               sense of it all. Through 3 hours of engaged activities, "Think Alouds", "It would be nice"s,
               and general brainstorming, we were able to make great progress in understanding how our app 
               should be designed and developed to solve our problem statement. <b>My particular role involved
               contributing to affinity diagramming and major theme dissemination.</b> I discovered that 
               there were preferences that were all over the place so allowing for preference specification
               was an important development for our app.
            </p>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Artifact 4 - Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <div class="proj-item">
            <p>Afterwards, we decided to see what else was out there in terms of an app that fulfilled
               part or all of what our app was trying to accomplish. Each team member decided to do a 
               comparative/competitive analysis to find out exactly what brought success to the more mainstream
               apps and what our app would do differently to be competitive in a crowded market such as 
               the restaurant app hemisphere of the app world. <b>For my part, I decided to review the 
               Starbucks app.</b> The Starbucks app was intriguing to me because Starbucks is universally known 
               as the most popular café that owns a huge chunk of the overall market share of cafés. I discovered
               , however, that our app has potential to do something that not even the great Starbucks corporation 
               can do; give the user a probability of seat availability.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Competitive Analysis</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3 style="text-align: right">Artifact 5 - Personas</h3>
        <div class="proj-item-left">
            <p>Now that our team had clarity of vision after doing some analysis of other apps, we thought
               it would be a good idea to understand the mind of the user. We drafted/sketched many personas, but 
               <b>the persona pictured is the one that I contributed most to.</b> As you can see, my partner and 
               I on this persona thought about the typical college student who is just too busy. Many college 
               students are looking for a pleasant ambiance where they can study. This persona is reflective of 
               that desire. It helped us greatly understand the mind of a café going student.
            </p>
            <figure class="proj-img">
                <img class ="myImg" src="./img/persona.png" alt="Personas">
                <figcaption>Personas</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Artifact 6 - User Flow Diagram</h3>
        <div class="proj-item">
            <p>Incidentally, the same partner from the persona creation and <b>I then got paired up to work on a 
               user flow diagram.</b> This diagram is a particularly useful tool when designing the ins and outs of 
               how a user may interact with the eventual product that we were venturing to design and develop. I was 
               in charge of drafting the user's usage flow of the Home screen, Bookmarks and More screens. What was 
               interesting was that I found much correlation between all three of those screens which I attempted to 
               show in the user flow diagram.
            </p>

                <img class="myImg" src="./img/flow.png" alt="User Flow">
                <figcaption>User Flow Diagram</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Relevance and Impact</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, Through our research we discovered that this is a much needed product. Many individuals love 
                studying at cafés(outside of our research group) and all have unique preferences for decibel levels of 
                noise and ambiance. We want to ensure that our product can help students and all individuals navigate 
                to a location based on their preferences of not only availability of seats, but also noise level and user reviews/ratings. 
                Once this application is prototyped and developed, we can expect to see many users finding satisfaction 
                as they will essentially be able to not only find the right café to frequent, but know in advance if their 
                café meets up to their expectations and preferences.
            <p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align: right">Proposed App Features: The Result of Design</h3>
        <div class="proj-item-left">
            <p>We decided for our lofi and hifi mockups to include these features: <b>Amazon Web Services, panorama service to
               feed into a patented algorithm which will predict foot traffic in a café; used to calculate seat availability probability,
               an onboarding process where users put in preferences(age, noise level, location, etc), visuals of café and estimated
               wait time, user ratings/stats/comments, resources available at the café, and also to show what the café might be suitable
               for(socializing, school work, professional meetings).</b> The lo fi mockup to the left was done by our very talented
               teammate Vimala. (Although most team members made their own mockups as well!)
            </b>
            </p>

                <figcaption>Lo Fi Mockups</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Moving Forward...</h3>
            <p>We can expect great things from Créma, our application, as it proceeds beyond version 1.0. While we are ambitious in the 
                features we are offering for the first version, we also realize there is much to be done from what our research suggests. 
                In the end, we hope to bring café lovers everywhere a product that they can use in their daily lives so they can brighten 
                their mornings or burn the night oil to accomplish their needs at a café of their choice.
