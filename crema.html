        <div class="proj-item">
            <p>Many students, working professionals and everyone in between love to get a 
            cup of brew to get their mornings off to a right start. Among those individuals, 
            there are many who additionally enjoy the ambiance of a café to be productive. 
            While the desire to fulfill this yearning may be strong, at times it is met with 
            an abrupt cessation as they realize that there are no more seats available at 
            their favorite cafés; much often too late. This can be a troublesome occurrence 
            at day break because the rest of their day can be altered adversely.

        <h3>Artifact 1 - Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>“Have you ever walked to a cafe to study, only to find that there are no tables open? 
            Now you have to find another cafe and take your chances there. The time of busy students 
            is precious. Our company, Shark Brains Inc, is developing SeatSpotter, an innovative 
            approach to boost personal productivity and cafe operational efficiency. SeatSpotter 
            is designed to help college students who love coffee and like studying at cafes solve 
            issues with maximum capacity limits being met and the inability of finding a seat. It will 
            provide live space availability information through AWS Panorama API calls and our own 
            patented AI machine learning algorithm to notify users of the probability of securing a seat.”</p>
